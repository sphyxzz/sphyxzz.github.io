*Keith Sophia B. Bombita*

This poem is related to me right now. This poem is about how I look for my loved one. Through out the entire text I expresses my loss for hope and courage, questioning whether not should live and love of his departed, and I was tremendous fears of losing my precious memories of my loved one. 
# Too Late
I never thought I could fall in love 

But you made me think otherwise 

I did fall in love again, with you

You made my dark skies light up again

You were eveything to me

But I couldn't say it to you

Before I knew it, I was gone from you life

In was too late..

I regret not saying it sooner

I'm sorry I didn't say "I love You
